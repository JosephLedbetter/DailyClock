Overview: 
The daily clock application provided contains an HTML that uses setInterval as the running JS function to provide a
real-time update to the second of the daily time. This project is based off the Eastern Standard Timezone. When completing 
the project it includes the jQuery CDN. 

You will be met with the message "Hello!" and the clock will initiate shortly after reflecting the current time.
